# Why did you changed your previous code?

I'm wondering about why are you asking this question, because previous version of code was garbage code.

I put all codes in the `Main.java` file. As a result, converted Kotlin file got fucked.

So I decided to remove some commands, and maked more clean codes, plus more funtionalities.

If you're still wondering about my old codes, you can check on my [[Second account](https://github.com/qogusdn1017-BHW-SecondAccount/BaeHyeonWooPL)].
